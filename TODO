A list of features to be worked on, implemented, updated, etc. They are
currently in no particular order. Some of these features have been tackled by
Krzys Miernik, but have not been implemented as of yet.

* DOCUMENTATION CHECK and UPDATE
* Fix issues with the TraceAnalyzers, plotters, filterers, etc. - They are not
    plotting properly.
* Incorporate the Globals.xml in a coherent way.
* Incorporate changes necessary for Pixie-500 data (MAJOR)
* Update statistics analysis
* Add support for subsubtypes throughout? (Especially to make subtype summaries
    work)
* 48-bit times in RawEvent
* ROOT histogramming
* Smarter (magic) dependency checking
* Find a cogent way to set the analyzer level using "trace" parameter
    from map2.txt
* Add some conglomerated location/type/subtype structure
* Output a simple histogram list
* Roll-over times for scalar/deadtime spectra
* Check for calibrated energies greater than zero which are always true due to
    float-izing digital values.
* Add a simple method to zero certain rows or columns of 2D histograms
* Hijack KM's readhis library to create his files natively in C
* For Redhat systems, libstdc++.so.5 is necessary to compile with ROOT support.
    Compilation needs to be streamlined in this case.
*Sandbox Processor:
  - simple processor that people can use to play with different features
  - Expand syntax from detector summary to get all detectors with specific tag,
  loc, etc.
