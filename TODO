DOCUMENTATION CHECK and UPDATE
Incorporate changes necessary for Pixie-500 data (MAJOR)
Update statistics analysis
Add support for subsubtypes throughout? (Especially to make subtype summaries work)
48-bit times in RawEvent
ROOT histogramming
Smarter (magic) dependency checking
Find a cogent way to set the analyzer level using "trace" parameter from map.txt
Add some conglomerated location/type/subtype structure
Output a simple histogram list
Incorporate KM's trace analyzer/correlator.
Roll-over times for scalar/deadtime spectra
Check for calibrated energies greater than zero which are always true due to float-izing digital values.
Add a simple method to zero certain rows or columns of 2D histograms
Hijack KM's readhis library to create his files natively in C

For Redhat systems, libstdc++.so.5 is necessary to compile with ROOT support. Compilation needs to be streamlined in this case.
